    <h2>Proposition: The majority of complaints against NYPD officers are not substantiated and do not result in disciplinary action against the officer(s) involved, suggesting insufficient judicial policies.

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					This pie chart shows that among all complaints from 2000 to 2015, only one-third of all complaints, where the involved member of service was identified as at fault, have resulted in resulting corrective or displinary action.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>I chose to use a pie chart. I think that this choice has a score of 1.</strong> I don’t think that there is much deception just in the choice of using a pie chart, especially because this is a simple way to compare two main categories. This makes it easy for the reader to determine the main trend we want to highlight, so I think that it is not a fully earnest choice because the simplicity of the graph makes it easier for the reader to look over it quickly and not fully examine the validity of the visualization.
				</li>
				<li><strong>I aggregated all the data from 2000 to 2015.</strong> I think that this choice has a score of -2 because I intentionally chose to aggregate the data to “hide” the change in ratios over the years (hinting at the motivation of the “Against” visualization). I decided to aggregate all the data rather than comparing across years because I think that seeing a visualization that highlights the breakdown across all the years almost makes the reader assume that this is the trend that is observed every year and further emphasizes the difference in percentages, whereas having an extra axis of years could make the visualization more complex and detract from the main message of the visualization. Including year-by-year data would shift the focus to change over time rather than differences between categories within each year. However, by using an aggregate percentage rather than computing the average percentage across all 15 years, the difference is larger, which further supports the proposition,
				</li>
				<li><strong>I chose red for the “No action” and green for the “Corrective action”.</strong> I think that this choice would have a score of -1. I think that this decision is slightly deceptive because we naturally associate red with bad and green with good, so we see that the green (good) portion is much smaller so the reader might automatically assume that this system is “bad” because it has a lot of red. I considered many other color palettes like grey for no action taken and a brighter color for corrective action taken, but this did not hold the same effect because it only emphasized the corrective action portion, whereas the goal of the visualization was to show the drastic imbalance in results of complaints.
				</li>
				<li><strong>I chose to filter out the exonerated complaints from this visualization.</strong> I think that this choice has a score of 2. In order to create a visualization in support of the proposition, I wanted to focus only on the results of complaints where the member of service (MOS) was at fault. I think that this choice is very earnest and only helps promote the simplicity of the visualization, because we are able to compare 2 categories rather than having to also include a third category where the MOS was not at fault. This category is not relevant to the claim that many corroborated complaints do not result in corrective action.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="AgainstGraph.png" alt="" id="responsive-image" />
				<figcaption>
					This line graph shows that from 2000 to 2015, the total number of complaints that have resulted in corrective or displinary action has increased dramatically, proving an improvement in disciplinary policies against NYPD members of service.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>I chose to use a line chart displaying data across years.</strong> I would give this choice a score of 2. It is a fully earnest choice because only the choice to use a line graph is not deceptive and is a common way to display trends over time. I think that using a line graph versus another graph makes the overall trend easier to see, and shows a continuous line over time, representing a measure that is changing year by year. 
				</li>
				<li><strong>I plotted the total number of complaints with corrective action and did not normalize by including data on complaints with no action.</strong> I would give this choice a score of -2. This is a fully deceptive choice because it hides information that would contextualize and normalize the numbers plotted. The goal of the visualization is to show that there has been a significant increase in corrective action over time, suggesting that there has been improvement in the judicial processes. However, this graph is hiding external factors that could be pushing up this number. For example, the number of complaints closed in later years also increased, but that is not included in this graph. Also, by including numbers rather than percentages, we only see the overall number increasing.
				</li>
				<li><strong>I filtered the years to only include 2000-2015.</strong> I think that this choice gets a score of -1. While filtering the data to a smaller time window is helpful for focusing on a trend, I did specifically choose this window because there was a significant increase over time. However, I do not think this is fully deceptive compared to the other visualization (pie chart) because that data was also filtered from 2000 to 2015, so the data used is not different. 
				</li>
				<li><strong>I annotated the low and high points.</strong> I think that this choice gets a score of -0.5 because it is not fully deceptive but is intended to highlight the increase. It is not adding or hiding any information, but it just makes the reader immediately see those two points and compare them.
				</li>
				<li><strong>I made the line green.</strong> I think that this choice gets a score of -0.5. It is a pretty neutral choice but leans towards deceptive because similar to the pie chart, green is associated with “good”. However, because there is only 1 line, I don’t think that the color of the line has much of an effect as opposed to when there are two categories with different colors. 
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>I think that this was a pretty fun process and definitely forced me to think outside of the box. It was very easy for me to make the visualization in support of the proposition because I think that I created the proposition after looking at most of the data, so I had many options. On the other hand, making the visualization against the proposition was very difficult because there was almost no data to support this side of the argument. I had to think about a different way to argue against the proposition, so I chose to show improvement over time to argue against the proposition. I was surprised that the final visualization against the proposition is actually pretty simple and the title is fully reflected in the visualization. If I am a reader and this visualization is in an article I am reading casually, I would honestly not question it too much due to the simplicity of the chart. For me, I think that ethical analysis and visualization boils down to data transparency. I think that bias is inherent and inevitable in data visualizations, but being open about how the data in the visualizations was created. I also think that context is very necessary, so I honestly think that both of these visualizations aren’t fully ethical. I’m not sure if there is a standard boundary I can draw between acceptable and misleading choices, because it depends so much on the context and the dataset. For example, sometimes it’s alright to not include all the data if it isn’t relevant, but sometimes it is deceptive. However, as a reader, we don’t know whether the excluded data is relevant or not, which is what gives power to deceptive visualizations. I think that in general, if data is purposefully excluded to distort the trend to show something different, that is considered misleading, but if it is excluded to simplify the visualization and reduce noise, it is acceptable. Of course, this definition is not concrete and is dependent on the person, but I think that in general, if a reader’s perception of the visualization would change or even flip to the other side of the proposition if more data was included, then the choice is deceptive.
